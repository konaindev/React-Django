# Data

## data/dumped/

Data that can be loaded with `manage.py loaddata data/dumped/foo.json`

The key content (right now) is project data (baseline and performance data) for Two Lincoln Towers.

All dumpdata files include a Django superuser with email `test@psl.com` and password `test1234`.

## data/sources/

Raw source data, in various forms (CSVs, etc) that is used to load our database for test purposes.

## data/schema/

_Very_ preliminary thinking on the "shape" of report data handed between the back-end and the front-end.

This takes the form of (1) javascript that "defines" the shape of each type of data, and (2) sample JSON for every report type, which JSON is generated by running the underlying javascript.
